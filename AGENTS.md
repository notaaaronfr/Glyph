## Style and Structure

- Prefer private modules with an explicitly exported public crate API. Internals are `pub(crate)`.
- Name modules for what they own, not `utils` or `common`
- Inline format args: always prefer `format!("{x}")` over positional.
- Collapse if statements per clippy::collapsible_if.
- Prefer method references over closures per clippy::redundant_closure_for_method_calls.
- Make `match` statements exhaustive; avoid wildcard arms.
- New traits need concise doc comments explaining their role and how implementations are expected to behave.
- No opaque positional `bool`/`Option` parameters (`foo(false)` is unreadable). Prefer enums,
  named methods, or newtypes. If you must pass an opaque literal by position, use an exact
  `/*param_name*/` comment matching the callee signature.
- Prefer native RPITIT trait methods with explicit `Send` bounds
  (`fn foo(&self) -> impl Future<Output = T> + Send;`) over `#[async_trait]` or
  `#[allow(async_fn_in_trait)]`. Implementations may use `async fn` when they satisfy the contract.
- No single-use helper methods. Do not create a helper referenced only once.
- Instrument async work at the definition (`#[tracing::instrument(...)]`), not with
  `.instrument(...)` at call sites. Check whether the callee is already instrumented first.

## Repository

- **Never set git identity for commits to this repo's history.** Agents must not set
  `user.name`/`user.email` (config or `-c`) or `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`/
  `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`/`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` for commits that land in this repository.
  Those commits carry the identity of the ambient git config. Try to use the active `gh` account.
- **Never add `Co-authored-by` trailers** — not in commit messages, not in squash
  suggestions, not as attribution for work merged from branches. A PR's commits carry
  one identity: the ambient git config's. Fabricated or hand-written trailers (including
  noreply forms) misattribute commits to unrelated GitHub accounts.
- Use the [PR Template](CONTRIBUTING.md#pr-template) in `CONTRIBUTING.md` when opening PRs

## Tests

- Prefer whole-object equality comparisons over field-by-field checks.
- Do not add tests for statically defined values.
- Do not add negative tests for logic that was removed.
- Bug fixes need a regression test that fails without the fix.
- Tests must wait for observable readiness, not fixed sleeps or retry-to-green loops. If a test must be disabled, give a reason at the test. Use isolated ports and temporary paths, and restore shared state. Run focused tests when changing their behavior.
